# Docker Desktop Environment

Just a small project to play around with having a KDE desktop environment in a Docker container.

Build the image:
```
docker-compose build
```

Start the image:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

A xrdp server will be started. You can connect to the RDP port (3389) and login with root/root or desktop/desktop.
